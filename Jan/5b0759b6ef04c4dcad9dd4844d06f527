Real estate firm Optiven Group has opened an office in Kansas, US, to market its housing units. Group chief executive George Wachiuri said the move was aimed at addressing challenges Kenyans living in North America face when searching for properties. “Kenyans living in North America will now be able to sign their transfer documents, make payments and have title deeds delivered to them, which saves them the cost of travelling to Kenya,” he said. The move targets about 120,000 Kenyans living in the US known to be ardent property investors back home. Some US-based Kenyan groups have formed savings and credit organisations that invest back home while some local banks- run diaspora desks to tap investments from the Kenyans. Woo diaspora Kenyans The banks regularly conduct foreign missions to woo diaspora Kenyans to invest in real estate projects back home. Optiven said it had partnered with Equity Group to enable Kenyans acquire its properties by offering loans repayable in five years. Optiven, started 20 years ago, is engaged in purchase of large parcels of land later subdivided into smaller portions for sale. It is currently selling the 100 acre gated property, Amani Ridge, where it plans to build 400 luxury housing units, establish a 1.5-acre recreational area (Central Park), two water-gardens as well as seven garden courts at a cost of Sh8 billion.

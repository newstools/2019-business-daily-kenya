The county government of Kisumu is rolling out a Sh600 million fund to maintain roads in a programme meant to cover about 350km across the seven sub-counties. The county government announced that tenders for the construction and repair of roads had already been awarded and work launched. “We are finalising the policy on roads maintenance teams and beginning implementation while continuing with road construction projects,” said Governor Anyang' Nyong’o. Mr Nyong’o said the road maintenance teams will employ the youth. “We will launch implementation of the village councils’ initiative upon conclusion of the legislation process to ensure labour-based contracts are awarded to the youth to maintain the roads after they are done,” he said. Roads, Transport and Public Works executive Thomas Ondijo said selected youth and some staff will be sent for training at the Kenya Institute of Highways and Building Technology in Kisii County to acquire skills to ensure proper maintenance of roads. “We won’t comprise on quality. We are giving a notice to all contractors doing the work that we will not hesitate to recall their performance bonds and even blacklist them should they fail to ensure value for our money,” Mr Ondijo said. He said that Sh230 million from the Kenya Roads Board had been set aside for the projects. “Another Sh350 million from the County Revenue Fund kitty will be spent on developing the roads to enhance transport of people, goods and services,” Mr Ondijo added. The projects, he said, will be implemented in all the seven sub-counties.

Auditor-General Edward Ouko has questioned the award of contracts amounting to Sh 970.4 million by the Vihiga County government in the 2016/2017 financial year. In his latest report, Mr Ouko says 128 contractors were awarded deals for civil works in the county despite not being registered with the National Construction Authority (NCA) as required by law. Besides, the county reported a drop in revenue collection by Sh36.5 million or 26.3 per cent during the period under review. In the 2015/ 2016 financial year, the county collected Sh138.9 million but the revenue decreased to Sh102.4 million. Management failed to explain the difference of Sh4.5 million registered dueing revenue collected and the amount banked between July and November 2016. Yesterday, Governor Wilber Ottichilo said the issues raised took place during the tenure of former county boss Moses Akaranga. “The reported issues in this report constituted the bulk of the problems that my administration has been facing and confirms the challenges we have been working hard to resolve,” said Mr Ottichilo. He said that his administration has been working hard to clean up the county and institute “sustainable financial management systems to promote accountability in th use of public funds.” On pending bills, Mr Ottichilo said a report on the validity of the claims had been prepared and forwarded to Mr Ouko’s office. He said only genuine pending bills would be settled. In the audit report, contractors were paid Sh333.5 million out of the outstanding amount.

A court has directed Mombasa County to negotiate with a cosmetics firm that says the directive requiring residential and commercial buildings to have uniform colours will hurt its brand and earnings. Best Lady Cosmetic Ltd says its colour is pink while the county government wants the CBD painted white and blue, taking the ocean theme and eyeing tourism earnings. Mombasa Judge Eric Ogola has now directed the administration of governor Hassan Joho to have talks with Best Lady to ensure that its business and those of others are not compromised by the directive. “The parties are hereby directed to mediate on the issues raised in the petition within 30 days before the court considers delivering its ruling,” the judge said Justice Ogola noted that the CBD would look more beautiful if it was not restricted to the two colours. Best Lady, through lawyer Lesaigor Marcelino, has sued the county, arguing that the directive is likely to hamper its business of 15 years. He said a different colour will lead to loss of customers and business earnings. The county, through lawyer Paul Buti, argued the notice was issued to owners and not the tenants of the building like Best Lady. The matter will be mentioned on February 27.

Motorists are still paying Sh300 for parking space in Nairobi, nearly a month after the county assembly reduced the fee to Sh200. Parking attendants are charging Sh300 and the electronic payment service ejijiPAY, administered by JamboPay, is yet to be configured to charge the lesser amount -- which violates the new city bylaws. The county assembly slashed the fees by Sh100 in November and Governor Mike Sonko signed into law the bill that reduces the parking charges before Christmas. Complaints Robert Mbatia, the chairman of the county's Budget and Appropriations Committee said they have received complaints from motorists over the fees and are making follow-ups with the executive and JamboPay, who run the electronic payments platform. “We have been made aware and we are following up with the executive because it is an illegality. The administrator (JamboPay) have told us that they have not been instructed by the county government to adjust the systems,” Mr. Mbatia told the Business Daily. JamboPay remained coy on the issue, with a source at the firm saying that they will communicate in case of any changes if and when advised by City Hall. “We are waiting for instructions from the county. Once it is done, we will communicate,” the source told the Business Daily. Reduce burden In reducing the parking fee to Sh200, Mr Sonko saying it would reduce the burden on city motorists paying more for fuel after introduction of an eight per cent value-added tax on fuel last year. The reduced fee was also part of efforts to increase compliance from motorists who preferred to bribe parking attendants and avoid paying Sh300 to park their cars.

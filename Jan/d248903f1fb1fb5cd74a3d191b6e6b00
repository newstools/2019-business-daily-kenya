The Law Society of Kenya (LSK) has filed a suit seeking to stop the arrest of lawyers for their professional work and offering free personal bond when arrested. LSK in the suit filed on Monday accuse prosecution and police of harassing lawyers who fail to reveal dealings between them and their clients. The lawyers are citing a trend of arrests on Friday afternoon. The lawyers lobby argues that advocates have a right to charge legal fees as per the Advocates Act in possible reference to the recent arrest of Tom Ojienda over services offered to the troubled Mumias Sugar Company. In the petition, the LSK has attached what it says is the evidence of alleged harassment of lawyers relating to charges facing Prof Ojienda and deputy chief justice Philomena Mwilu. “That this honourable court do grant a temporary injunction against the respondents to prohibit them from arresting and prosecuting any advocate of High Court in relation to their work and obligations under the Advocates Act,” reads one of the orders sought by LSK. DPP is seeking to charge Prof Ojienda with financial misappropriation and fraudulent dealings at the sugar miller in which Sh89 million was paid. Ms Mwilu was charged in court with abuse of office. LSK says lawyers act on behalf of clients and they are mandated to maintain confidentiality.

The winners are judged on service delivery and effective management voted for by International tour operators, travel agents and hotel guests who get the opportunity to cast their votes annually. The award organisers described the Turkish hotel as a luxury five-star hotel retreat with two private beaches and excellent leisure facilities, guests are invited to lie back, relax and savour the moment. “With an idyllic location in Paradise Bay, Mandarin Oriental, Bodrum offers a seductive blend of style, serenity and five-star comfort.

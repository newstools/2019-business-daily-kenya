President Uhuru Kenyatta Wednesday launched the construction of Kenya’s first double-decker road set to link the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport (JKIA) to Nairobi-Nakuru highway. The Kenya National Highways Authority (KeNHA) said the Sh59 billion project would be financed under the public-private partnership (PPP). The China Road and Bridge Corporation (CRBC) is the investor. The road is expected to reduce the heavy traffic gridlocks along Mombasa Road, which starts from the Mlolongo to the city centre. Transport Secretary James Macharia told the Business Daily in May that motorists would have the option of using the express way to escape the heavy traffic jams at a fee. The private firm building the road is expected to recover its investments from the toll charges. Motorists using the lower section of the double-decker highway would, however, be spared the toll charges. The project has a design speed of 80 kilometres per hour and starts at Mlolongo, connecting to the JKIA and Nairobi central business district before terminating at James Gichuru road. “It measures 27 kilometres in length, with the first 15-kilometres to be constructed at grade level, while the last 11 kilometres will be constructed as an elevated road,” said the KeNHA in a statement yesterday. Ten interchanges are some of the special features set to be erected on the highway. The agency indicated that the interchanges would be constructed after considering factors such as existing road networks, topography, land acquisition and return on investment. The project has delayed for nearly a decade. The first construction attempt collapsed when the World Bank questioned its suitability and cut financing. The proposed elevated dual carriageway is to be built in three phases beginning with the first 6.5 kilometres running from JKIA to Likoni Road and the Southern Bypass interchange.

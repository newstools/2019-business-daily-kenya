National Oil, incorporated in 1981, is involved in the marketing of petroleum products (downstream), development of petroleum infrastructure (midstream) and exploration of oil and gas (upstream activities). The firm began operations in 1984 and its strategic mandate is to play a price-stabilising role and arrest any cartel-like behaviour by private marketers.

Kenya discovered commercial oil in 2012 in its Lokichar basin, which Tullow Oil estimates contains 560 million barrels in proven and probable reserves. Tullow has said this would translate to 60,000 to 100,000 barrels per day of gross production. In August, Kenya shipped out 200,000 barrels of the Turkana crude to test the international markets’ reception of the low-sulphur oil ahead of commercial production, which is expected to start in the second half of 2023. Production is now estimated to start in the second half of 2023. Tullow has been moving the oil by road to Mombasa.

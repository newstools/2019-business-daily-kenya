Lecturers Monday signed a collective bargaining agreement (CBA) awarding them Sh8.8 billion, ending months of negotiations and a looming threat of industrial action. The counter-offer from government comprises Sh7 billion basic pay and an additional Sh1.8 billon for pension. The 9,000 lecturers had a month ago rejected a counter-offer of between 23 and 25 percent pay rise for two years. “We’ve just concluded and signed the 2017-2021 CBA with universities councils that is effective July1, 2017,” Universities Academic Staff Union (Uasu) secretary general Constantine Wasonga told journalists. Negotiations between the Uasu and universities through the Inter-Public Universities Councils Consultative Forum kicked off in January 2018. In March 2018, the lecturers went on strike over the CBA for 78 days, ending it after signing a return-to-work formula with the government.

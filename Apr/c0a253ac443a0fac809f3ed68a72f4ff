The number of tenders by State corporations and agencies published online in line with a presidential directive has increased by nearly three and half times since last September. The online portal, which was established in July 2018, listed 15,519 tenders worth Sh102.28 billion that were awarded to 7,876 registered suppliers. This represents a 340.29 per cent increase compared with the 2,566 tenders worth Sh23.23 billion listed in September. But many State agencies continue to defy President Uhuru Kenyattaâ€™s June order to publicly release details of the multi-billion shilling tenders through the designated public procurement website to curb graft. Mr Kenyatta said publication of the tenders would allow the public to scrutinise the deals, including the quality and amounts of goods and services bought as well as the cost, and identity of the suppliers. On January this year Deputy President William Ruto directed the Treasury to submit a list of all public bodies who have defied the government order on tender disclosure to the Head of Public Service within 30 days.

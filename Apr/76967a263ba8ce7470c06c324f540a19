The fact that Kenya’s health sector is in deep crisis is no longer news. The public health sector has been at a crossroads and unable to fully address the perennial shortage of workers and appropriate equipment and frequent strikes. The latest action by the Kenya Medical Practitioners, Pharmacists and Dentists’ Board to deregister 2,063 or 22 percent of the country’s doctors is set to add pain in our ailing health system. However, Kenyans expect it to achieve the greater goal of cleaning up the rot in the sector and improving service delivery. The board has defended the move saying that the doctors did not comply with some of its requirements. That means doctors have themselves to blame for falling short of the Continuing Professional Development rules and not applying for retention. And as the board was quick to kick out those who have fallen short of the standards set for them, it should also bring back to the fold those who take steps to comply with the rules and regulations. True, the suspensions have complicated efforts to address the biting shortage of doctors but it is a worthy price to pay for a cleaner, more friendly and more efficient health services system.

Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko says he will only appoint a deputy once Parliament enacts a law spelling out the procedure of filling the vacancy that arose following the resignation of Polycarp Igathe. Mr Sonko told the Senate Wednesday that there is no law that compels a governor to appoint a deputy governor following resignation, death or assent to the office of governor by the previous one. The County Government (Amendment) Bill, 2017, which stipulates the procedure of filling a vacancy, has yet to be enacted into law. Mr Igathe resigned on January 31, 2018, citing failure to earn the trust and respect of Governor Sonko. “As soon as there is a legal framework, I will proceed to nominate my deputy within a second. But as things stand now, I will not nominate one until the pending legislation is passed by Parliament and assented to by the President,” Mr Sonko told the Senate committee on Devolution and Intergovernmental Relations chaired by Laikipia Senator John Kinyua. Mr Sonko appeared before the committee to respond to a statement sought by Nairobi Senator Johnson Sakaja.

A two-day system outage left KCB M-Pesa customers unable to access some services from the platform, including getting loans during the Easter holiday season. The system downtime, which started around Sunday midday, comes just a few months after KCB M-Pesa migrated to a new platform that enables customers to roll over their loans to the next month. The delays persisted till early Monday before being resolved. Users of KCB M-Pesa, who currently stand at over 14 million, were however in a position to repay their outstanding loans. “There was a temporary system hitch affecting KCB M-Pesa customers earlier today which has since been rectified and services restored. “We apologise to to all the customers for the inconveniences caused,” said KCB in response to Business Daily’s queries Monday.

Former National Land Commission (NLC) chairman Muhammad Swazuri and 10 other officials accused of corruption were yesterday released on cash bail ranging from between Sh1.5 million and Sh12 million. Chief magistrate Lawrence Mugambi directed Prof Swazuri, former commissioner Emma Njogu, former NLC chief executive officer Tom Aziz Chavangi, Dr Salome Munubi, director valuation and taxation and the Commission secretary Lilian Kaverenge to deposit cash bail of Sh12 million to secure their release. Other accused persons were released on cash bail of Sh6 million, yet others who only face one count were ordered to deposit between Sh1.5 million and Sh3 million to get back their freedom. Meanwhile, five more suspects denied the charges after presenting themselves before the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission, as the court issued warrants for the arrest of the other suspects who are still at large. Prof Swazuri and 11 accused were charged on Thursday last week and had to spend the Easter holiday behind bars as the magistrate postponed the ruling to yesterday. The court said there was no evidence to show that the accused would interfere with the trial or that they were a flight risk. They have denied more than 20 counts, including corruption and abuse of office.

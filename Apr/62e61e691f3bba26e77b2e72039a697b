East African Legislative Assembly (EALA) members say the strength of the Kenya shilling in the East African Community market is working against local traders. The shilling has been largely stable even as other currencies, led by Tanzania, wobble. “We are faced by a situation where farm produce from all other member countries is being dumped in our market. “With a strong Kenyan currency, those member states are selling at lower prices in our market,” said Simon Mbugua. He says relevant Kenya ministries have not factored in exchange rates in determining rules of engagement. Wanjiku Muhia said Kenya stands, so far, as the major beneficiaries of the EAC free market “but there are loose ends that ought to be sealed”. “But there is no need to worry since we are debating laws to address the issue. We are gaining ground in enacting a single currency. The East Africa Monetary Institute Bill 2017 and the Statistics Bureau Bill 2017 are all set to give us a foot forward in this aspect,” she said. According to Mr Mbugua, Kenya is now acting like a ‘dumpsite’ for all the surpluses of farm produce within the EAC hence inconveniencing local producers. Kenya is currently experiencing a biting drought.

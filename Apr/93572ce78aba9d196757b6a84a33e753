The Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC) has changed its name to the Energy and Petroleum Regulatory Authority (EPRA) following the coming into force of the Energy Act of 2019. The industry regulator, through a notice published in local dailies Thursday, said the change that came into effect last month is part of its re-alignment to relevant laws. “This is to notify the general public that following enactment of the Energy Act 2019, the ERC has changed to the Energy and Petroleum Regulatory Authority with effect from March 28th, 2019,” the agency said. President Uhuru Kenyatta assented to the Bill last month. The law is intended to see EPRA regulate generation, importation, exportation, transmission, distribution, supply and use of electrical energy with the exception of licensing of nuclear facilities. Under the Act, licensing of nuclear facilities is now the mandate of the Nuclear Power and Energy Agency (NPEA) which was established under the Act alongside the Rural Electrification and Renewable Energy Corporation (REREC). The ERC was established under the Energy Act of 2006. The name change comes amid an on-going row between EPRA and Kenya Power over who has mandate to approve and license new power plants.

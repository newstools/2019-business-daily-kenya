The Kenya Airports Authority (KAA) has come out to apologise over the poor state of toilet facilities at the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport (JKIA). In a statement on its Twitter handle, KAA said the washrooms are in poor state due to vandalism. KAA made the statement after Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko, who arrived in Nairobi yesterday morning from London, expressed his dismay on social media about the pathetic state of the facilities. The authority added that the toilets are currently being repaired. “Our attention has been drawn to concerns on social media relating the washrooms at JKIA. These cases are as a result of vandalism which we are unfortunately experiencing at the airport,” KAA’s statement read. “We currently have a contractor on the ground who is systematically repairing and replacing the defective equipment. We apologise for any inconvenience caused.”

Subscription and pay TV viewers will be required to input a code to watch programmes deemed only suitable for adults, the communications regulator has announced in newly gazetted rules aimed at protecting children from unsuitable content. The latest programming code for broadcasters issued by the Communications Authority of Kenya (CA) comes as the popularity of pay TV content grows. It replaces the code that came to force in 2016 and only targeted the free- to- air television providers. The new code makes it mandatory for pay TVs to issue consumer advice such as warnings, labelling and classification details prior to the telecast of any programme or its trailer. “Classification details or rating should be shown throughout while the programme is running. However, this does not diminish the broadcaster’s responsibility for sensitive scheduling of programmes to reduce the risk of causing offence,” says the new code. Further, all programmes broadcast between 5am and 10 pm, usually called watershed period, will have to be suitable for family listening and viewing. “Providers shall provide mandatory restricted access such as a PIN protected system (or other equivalent protection) that restricts access solely to those authorised to view,” directs the code. In 2015, Kenya transitioned from a largely free-to-air TV into a pay-to-watch regime when analogue signals were switched off.

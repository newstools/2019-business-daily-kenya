The Kenya Medical Practitioners and Dentists Board (KMPDB) has delisted 2,063 doctors and 212 dentists for failure to apply for retention in its register, setting up the medics for a fine of Sh20,000 and risk of deregistration. KMPDM Chief Executive Officer Daniel Yumbya said t some of the doctors were delisted for failure to apply for retention this year while others did not meet the required professional upgrade points commonly known as Continuing Professional Development (CPD). The removed medics, who account for 22 per cent of Kenya’s doctors, risk a fine of Sh20, 000 if found practising and could be scrapped off roll. CPD is defined as training that leads to broadening of knowledge and skills and doctors are required to acquire 50 points in a calendar year. “We are meeting again at the end of June and those who have not complied by then risk being deregistered. In the meantime, those who continue to work without it are practising illegally and if sued for any form of malpractice we will treat them as unlicensed,” he said. He said doctors can apply for re-listing upon payment of Sh4,000, adding that those who have not met the CPD points must seek the professional upgrade training. “The doctors and dentists knew about the requirements and were given ample time to comply but they simply failed,” said Mr Yumbya. Following the delisting the number of retained medical practitioners are 6993 and 743 dental practitioners. Mr Yumbya said that it was up to the hospitals to ensure their employees are registered and not practicing in contravention of the law.

Patients using Safaricom-backed healthcare app CarePay to settle medical bills will now be able to use facilities at all Aga Khan hospitals. This comes after CarePay and Aga Khan Health Service signed a memorandum of understanding allowing CarePay and M-Tiba platforms to be integrated into its systems. M-Tiba, which started operations last year, allows those registered on a savings or private insurance scheme to access treatment and pay via M-Pesa. CarePay chief executive Kees van Lede said more Kenyans would be able to access quality healthcare that would promptly be paid for. M-Tiba currently has more than 2,000 healthcare providers. Aga Khan regional chief executive Sulaiman Shahabuddin said the deal presented them with a new mode of payment for services that could improve the health of Kenyans. They also agreed to launch healthcare inclusion programmes for Aga Khan hospitals in Kisumu, Mombasa and Nairobi.

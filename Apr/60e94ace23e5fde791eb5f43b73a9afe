Kisumu County has allocated Sh102 million for a land bank set up, planning of new towns and establishment of a valuation roll as it moves to streamline land issues affecting the region. The land bank will cost Sh20.2 million, according to the budget estimates for the year 2019/20. The land bank will ensure they county gets its own parcels to offer as incentives to investors. For instance, it plans to use the yet to be designated land as equity to secure funding for housing. Land has been a controversial issue in Kisumu with cases of grabbing, forged title deeds and lack of clear land tenure affecting housing projects planned for the lakeside county. Kanyakwar, Kibos, Migosi, Mamboleo, Milimani, Nyalenda ‘B’, Dunga, Maseno and Lake Victoria riparian reserves are some of the areas with land conflict. Other areas where there have been queries over allocation of land include plots next to Lake Victoria stretching between Lwang’ni beach and Ismailia cemetery and Kasagam. A month ago, Governor Anyang’ Nyong’o revealed to journalists that the preliminary findings of a report on land issues carried out by a task force had “frightening revelations.” “The report shows massive misuse of land and grabbing of parcels,” said the Governor. The National Lands Commission had, in a Gazette notice dated July 17, 2018 also revoked hundreds of title deeds on grounds that they were irregularly acquired. In the budget estimate, the governor has also allocated Sh10 million for house renovations, Sh6 million for planning and surveying of market centres and Sh30 million to come up with a valuation roll. In the recently concluded Legislative Summit in Kisumu, the Treasury pointed out that lack of a proper valuation rolls in counties were costing them millions in land rates.

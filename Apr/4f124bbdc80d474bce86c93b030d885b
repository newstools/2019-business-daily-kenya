Murang’a Governor Mwangi wa Iria wants the proposed Sh3 billion coffee revolving fund put on hold so as to first put in place anti-graft measures. He said the cash, if released without measures to guide disbursement “as is tradition in most of our agriculture sectors, will not serve the intended purpose of uplifting coffee farmers”. The fund is set to be operationalised in July. President Uhuru Kenyatta had said the kitty is part of his agenda to rejuvenate the sector that has been experiencing a tough run. The fund will be accessed by coffee farmers at an interest rate of three per cent. But the Governor notes the sector has been operating without oversight structures, claiming that part of Sh1.4 billion the central government disbursed in the 2016/17 financial year to write off central region coffee farmers’ debts was stolen. This was part of the Sh4 billion the government said was waived for coffee farmers countrywide. He said the President should first purge graft in the financial institutions that received the money, saying nearly 60 per cent was stolen. “The President is the one who publicly announced disbursement of that cash to offset coffee farmers’ debts in Central region. But our farmers continue to be indebted to their societies since the cash was stolen,” he charged. He called for a probe on farmers’banking institutions and how coffee societies’ management drew lists of the debts owed by farmers and how the cash was utilised. “Of the Sh1.4 billion that was disbursed, our estimation at the Council of Governors where I am the deputy chairman, indicates that 60 per cent never serviced the debts intended to be waived off. The cash ended up in individuals’ pockets and they must be brought to book,” he said. The debts at issue funded coffee production in the 1990s. According to the Report of the National Task Force on Coffee Sub-Sector Reforms (2017), farmers owed unions, co-operatives and saccos a total of Sh4.78 billion.

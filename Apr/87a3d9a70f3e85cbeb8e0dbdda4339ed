Thousands of children attending private primary and secondary schools can now access medical insurance after their association signed a pact with insurance group Minet Kenya Consulting. Speaking during the Kenya Private Schools Association (Kepsa) annual general meeting in Mombasa last week, national chairperson Mutheu Kasanga said the scheme will cover medical emergencies arising in and out of school including trauma and asthma attacks. Others are hypertensive and diabetic crises, severe allergic reactions and severe food poisoning. Routine medical conditions that occur frequently but are not life-threatening as well as chronic ailments including depression, anxiety and other mood and emotional disorders that affect children’s day to day functions will be catered for as in and out patient treatments. “In April 2018, the government launched a medical cover for students in public secondary schools and the partnership we have signed today with Minet and NHIF will offer students in private schools’ similar access to medical cover enjoyed by their counterparts in the public school,” Ms Kasanga said last week. A group accident cover is also available in case of loss of life from accidental or natural causes up to a limit of Sh250,000. Accidental total and permanent disability cover has been set at Sh100,000. Medical expenses following an accident have been capped at Sh20,000. Costs of artificial appliances such as crutches, wheel chairs among others and costs for accidental dental treatment has been set at a limit of Sh20,000.

The promotion of 500 ageing police constables will go a long way in improving morale in the police service. It must be demotivating for a police officer who has served for so long, often in a harsh work environment, to retire at the same level one started and with a very low severance pay. However, it is also a pointer that there is a problem in the service. Without a defined system that ensures that all officers move to the next level in a fair and equitable way, the situation can easily result in resentment. It can be especially painful when officers see their younger colleagues move up while they remain at the same spot. Police officers perform a critical roles in the society, preventing crime and providing security and, in many instances, risking their lives in the line of duty. It behoves the government to provide a good working environment that guarantees career development and decent pay in appreciation. There is no reason a career officer who serves well and has no disciplinary cases should not get a promotion for decades. Their promotion is a critical first step as is the gesture to transfer those in hardship areas.

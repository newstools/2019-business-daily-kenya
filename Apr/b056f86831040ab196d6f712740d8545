A showdown is looming between Uasin Gishu County Assembly and the Executive over proposals by the House to adopt that a proposed law that will see the 30 electoral wards equally share the Sh1.2 billion development vote. The Assembly is in the process of getting the views which will see the 30 wards share Sh43 million development vote translating to Sh1.2 billion, a move which has not gone down well with Governor Jackson Mandago. The move contained in the County Equitable Development Bill,2019 will give authority to residents to decide on the use of funds within their areas unlike in the past when projects could receive allocations based on decisions of the county leadership. Mr Mandago has opposed the bill arguing that some wards will be disadvantaged as they are vast compared to others. “Let me manage distribution of resources because I was elected as governor. Stick to your role of oversight. Let’s sit down and talk, but I will not accept any attempts to incite the people,” said Mr Mandago. He questioned MCAs capacity to pay ECD teachers and manage water and roads and hospitals if left to manage the funds. “The seat of governors is to fulfil pledges in our manifestos. Mmeskia kazi imenishinda? (who told you I’ve been overwhelmed by work?)” Posed Mr Mandago in Eldoret on Saturday. The bill has already undergone the first reading in the assembly. Residents who spoke to the Business Daily in most e public hearings felt that the current format is denying them a chance to benefit from programmes that directly affect them. “This is a timely move as the people will own projects as we will prioritise projects as per our needs. Many projects have in the past stalled because of low allocation,” said John Cheruiyot, a resident of Ziwa ward. Ziwa ward MCA Joseph Korir assured the Executive that the Assembly will not interfere with the funds, noting that they will be managed by respective departmental heads.

Barely a day after the long-awaited rains came, one person died after her dwelling was washed away by a river that burst its banks. This sends a worrying message that authorities, particularly the City County government, are not well-prepared for emergencies should the rains become more pronounced. The team responsible for floods management must have been sleeping on the job because the weatherman predicted a prolonged drought. However, now that the rains are high, the team must be mobilised to ensure that waterways, canals and other infrastructure are well maintained to minimise flooding and prevent disaster. All counties should prepare wananchi to cope with the changing weather to prevent unnecessary deaths and diseases associated with the deluge. There are worrying reports that motorists are using damaged sections of key roads, exposing road users to needless danger. The transport authority should step in to educate motorists on how to navigate wretched weather. Regular updates are desirable. It is a worry that Kenyans should die because it has rained, yet the country has been anticipating it for long.

Kenya Power   is seeking to secure whistle-blowing services in the race to fight graft at the electricity distributor. The utility firm Wednesday invited bids for the unique services in a public tender. The firm said the subsequent solution to be provided by the winning bidder must enable whistle-blowers report issues of corruption in a highly secure as well as anonymous manner. “To embed a strong ethical culture, Kenya Power is putting in place an online anonymous reporting mechanism,” acting CEO Jared Othieno said Wednesday. “The professional firm will record, report, interpret, analyse and store data on unethical practices,” he added Corporate governance experts say whistle blowing is one of the most effective ways of exposing malfeasance within an organisation. According to the global Association of Certified Fraud Examiners, around 40 percent of all detected occupational fraud cases are identified by whistleblowers. The suspended chief executive of Kenya Power, his immediate predecessor and 10 other senior managers at the company were charged in court on Monday with conspiracy to commit an economic crime and abuse of office, court documents showed. CEO Ken Tarus, his predecessor, Ben Chumo, and the other executives pleaded not guilty to the charges. Mr Tarus and his fellow executives at Kenya Power are accused of entering a contract with a private firm for the supply of transformers, which turned out to be faulty.

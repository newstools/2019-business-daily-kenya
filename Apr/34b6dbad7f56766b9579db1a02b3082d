The Attorney General and the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) have dismissed claims by MPs allied to Deputy President William Ruto that the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) has no role in investigating corruption in the country. Kihara Kariuki, the AG, told MPs that those claiming that the DCI George Kinoti has no power under the law to investigate corruption do not understand the law. “That is a misunderstanding because of inadequate knowledge on the law,” Mr Kihara told the Justice and Legal Affairs committee last evening. Mr Kihara was supported by the EACC chief executive officer Twalib Mbarak who said the law allows the DCI to investigate all crimes including corruption and economic crimes. “The DCI is mandated to conduct investigations on crimes including economic crimes. They can do what we do as the EACC but we cannot do what they do,” Mr Mbarak told committee chairperson William Cheptumo. “On matters corruption, does the mandate lie with the EACC and not the DCI?” Mr Cheptumo had asked. A number of MPs allied to Dr Ruto have claimed the DCI has no capacity to investigate graft

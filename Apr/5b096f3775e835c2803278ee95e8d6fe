The National Transport and Safety Authority’s directive for fresh vetting and licensing of public service vehicle (PSV) body-builders is long overdue. For a long time, the regulator has turned a blind eye to the indirect role body-builders play in roads fatalities as a result of crashes. It is not lost on observers that the poor structural design of many PSVs makes them death traps, causing potentially preventable fatalities. Vital vehicle body parts such as emergency windows or doors that are sealed endanger passengers in case of an accident that requires quick escape. The seats are not attached to the chassis, as happens in other jurisdictions, further risking lives. According to the agency’s latest statistics, road fatalities as at April 11 have increased by 24.57 percent to 3,767 from 3,024 during similar time last year. Perhaps the Fort Ternan horror bus crash in which more than 50 passengers died last October best illustrates our road safety’s soft underbelly. Going forward, the NTSA should ensure that only certified body-builders who meet quality and safety standards are allowed to operate. The agency should also inspect public vehicles to ensure they meet safety standards.

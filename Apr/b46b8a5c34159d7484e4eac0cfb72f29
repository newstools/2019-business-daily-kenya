Kenyan banks have been tipped to turn sustainable development goals (SDGs) into business opportunities. It is estimated that the SDGs, adopted in late 2015, will cost between $90 trillion and $120 trillion by 2030. Africa Network Coordinator for Unep Finance Initiative and Independent Sustainability consultant Caroline Wakesho Sonje said in this light, the Kenyan financial services industry has a role to play in funding the objectives. “The principles for responsible banking are not just the global standard for a new way of banking, but importantly also a community — the community of banks who see it as their role and responsibility to make a significant contribution to tackling their society’s most pressing challenges and achieving a sustainable future for all of us around the globe — on a healthy planet,” said Ms Sonje during the eighth Annual Banking and Finance Conference 2019 held in Nairobi. The conference themed ‘Assessing the Business Drivers for the Banking & Finance Industry’ is organised by Kenyan firm Aidem Business Solutions Ms Sonje said Kenyan banks and other companies must explore what the global SDG goals mean to them.

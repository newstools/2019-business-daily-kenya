The Treasury has set aside half a billion shillings to settle the delayed compensation to persons injured or the next of kin of those killed by wild animals. Tourism and Wildlife Cabinet Secretary Najib Balala said Monday that his ministry and a team from the Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) have completed the verification and processing of the claims. No victim of human-wildlife conflict has been compensated for either loss of life or property damage since 2013, a government audit shows. The KWS owes victims Sh2.2 billion in unpaid compensation claims for the year 2014 to 2016 alone. “We have a budget allocated for compensation of about Sh500 million and Sh70 million has already been released to the KWS. The first batch of compensation will be issued straight away and then we will request for the balance from the Treasury so that it is paid,” said Mr Balala. Compensation for human death, injury or damage to property has been significantly increased under the new law that came into force on January 10, 2014. The law requires Sh5 million be paid for human death, Sh3 million for injury with permanent disability and up to Sh2 million for other injuries depending on their extent.

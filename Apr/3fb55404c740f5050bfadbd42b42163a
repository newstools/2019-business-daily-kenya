The co-operatives regulator has ordered an inquiry into the operations of Narok-based Good Hope Sacco. A Kenya Gazette notice by the regulator said the investigations would look into the by-laws, working and financial conditions of and the conduct of present or past management committees of Good Hope Sacco, formerly known as Narok Teachers Sacco. The sacco has been in the spotlight over allegations of mismanagement of members' funds. “I authorise Priscilla Maranga, assistant commissioner for Co-operatives Development, Headquarters and Hilda Koech Chepkwony, county director of Cooperative Audit, Bomet County to hold an inquiry within 20 days from the date thereof at such place and time as may be expedient and duly notified by them,” said acting commissioner for Co-operative Development Didacus Ityeng'. The inquiry comes amid claims of fraud and embezzlements of funds that have hit the sector, putting many Kenyans who saves in co-operatives on high alert. The Commissioner of Co-operatives on February 19 dissolved the seven-member board of Stima Investment Sacco after a forensic audit revealed massive fraud at the society, which has exposed members to losses exceeding half-a-billion shillings.

E-hailing taxi firm Uber has added a driver tipping feature within its app for card users. Uber customers will have the option of tipping drivers at the end of the ride, selecting from the pre-set amounts or a custom amount. “You can now show your appreciation for going the extra mile by tipping your driver directly through the Uber app after the trip has completed. A tip is an extra way to say thank you to a driver that’s gone above and beyond the usual expected service,” said Uber in a statement. The feature was first introduced in Uber’s other markets in 2017. According to the US company, it does not take any fees for the tips as it would for regular trip payments. For riders who are using split fare, the company says “the rider who originally requested the trip will be able to select the tip amount for the trip. If a tip is added by the original requester, it will not be split with the other passengers.” Customers must provide a rating for the driver to be presented the options of tipping the driver through the app. However, the tip can be done directly from the receipt without need for rating.

National Carrier Kenya Airways (KQ)  has reduced the number of flights on the Kisumu and Mombasa routes after the Easter festivities, withdrawing the Dreamliners it had deployed to the Coast region in a bid to cater for increased demand. Kenya Airways had deployed six flights between April 18 and April 22 from Nairobi to Mombasa using its Boeing 787 Dreamliner. The National carrier, which operates nine flights Monday to Friday and 10 over the weekend on both routes, had also added additional flights on its Q400 aircrafts between Nairobi and Kisumu in the same period on increased demand. “We have reduced the number of flights on the Mombasa and Kisumu routes after the Easter demand. The additional flights were meant to cushion us during the peak season which has now come to an end,” said an official from Kenya Airways who cannot be quoted because he is not authorised to speak on behalf of the firm. KQ, through low-cost subsidiary Jambojet, currently flies to Nairobi, Mombasa and Kisumu. It also operates Eldoret, Malindi and Ukunda routes targeting businessmen and tourists. Plans by KQ to reduce the number of flights on the Nairobi and Kisumu routes after the Easter season comes barely a few days after the National carrier resumed flights to Khartoum following a temporary suspension occasioned by political upheaval in the country. Sudan’s military ousted Bashir after weeks of mass protests that climaxed in a sit-in outside the Defence Ministry compound. Protests are continuing and their leaders say the unrest will not cease until the ruling Transitional Military Council (TMC) hands power to a civilian-led authority ahead of elections. The Sudanese Professionals’ Association (SPA), leading the revolt, has called for sweeping change to end violent crackdowns on dissent, purge corruption and cronyism and ease an economic crisis that worsened during Bashir’s last years in power.

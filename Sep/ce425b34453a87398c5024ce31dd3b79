"The committee will come up with a legal framework on how the secretariat shall run in collaboration with International Organisation of Pension Supervisors (IOPS)," said Mr Mutuku. Pension sectorThe newly created forum aims to steer development of the pension sector in Africa. The conference attracted delegates from eight African countries including Kenya, South Africa, Nigeria, Zambia, Uganda, South Sudan, Rwanda, Burundi. Other delegates came from Ireland, India and France. "We agreed that an African body independent of IOPS which has only 15 African members, could be useful in encouraging other African countries to join IOPS... we shall benchmark on IOPS to set standards and encourage other none members to adopt those standards," said Mr Mutuku. "Given the different levels of development across the African continent it was agreed that the Africa Pension Supervisors platform would benefit others who may not be able to join IOPS," he added. Mr Mutuku thanked the CEOs for appointing Kenya to chair the interim committee saying "Kenya is looking forward to deliver something they can be proud of in the next two years." The next Africa Pension Supervisors Forum shall be held in Rwanda.

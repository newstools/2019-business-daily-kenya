Brand Africa announced the latest rankings at the JSE in partnership with Geopoll, Kantar and Brand Leadership. Safaricom’s M-Pesa retained its lead among mobile money brands. Nike retains the overall number one brand in Africa spontaneously recalled by consumers. “The presence of multiple mobile money brands on the list, including Safaricom M-Pesa (ranked 13), Orange Money (18), MTN Mobile Money (19) and Tigo (23), underscores the impact of not only M-Pesa as the catalyst but mobile as a key enabler for financial access,” said the report.

Overall, African brands faltered to an all-time low of 14 percent share of the Top 100 most admired brands in Africa. “These rankings are an important metric of and challenge for creating home-grown competitive African brands that will transform the African promise and change its narrative and image as a competitive continent,” said Thebe Ikalafeng, founder and chairman of Brand Africa.

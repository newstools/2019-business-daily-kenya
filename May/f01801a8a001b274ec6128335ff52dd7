The policy decision by East African Breweries Limited’s parent firm, Diageo, to offer up to six months paid maternity leave is worthy of applauding because it speaks to the corporate entity’s concern about the welfare of its workers. Diageo’s move is notable because not many companies have taken that direction and the announcement that the workers in the local unit, EABL, will receive similar benefits will go a long way in improving staff morale and also productivity. Implementation of the policy has the potential to encourage a more diversified workforce from a gender perspective as it allows women to make a decision more quickly when it comes to choosing whom to work for when they have more than one choice. Many women and families would potentially be attracted to the prospect of such an arrangement, other factors held constant. Diageo’s move follows a similar one by Bloomberg LP that announced in mid-May that it had increased its parental leave to 26 weeks, equivalent to half a year, up from 18 weeks. It is a fitting reminder to many employers that they should take into account the welfare of their workforce beyond remuneration to improve on their working conditions.

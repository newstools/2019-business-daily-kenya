The National Environment Management Authority (Nema) is again on the spot for giving the green light for construction of a Sh11.2 billion cooking gas storage facility in Mombasa despite opposition from residents. Details of the clearance of the project to be constructed by Mombasa Gas Terminal Limited (MGT), a subsidiary of a Dubai-based firm come after Nema recently encountered stiff opposition for issuing a licence to build another Sh7.5 billion Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) storage plant near the Mombasa port. The project by Mansa East Africa was given approval din spite of objection raised by Ganjoni residents and State agencies charged with maritime protection. The residents were concerned for their safety. And now the Sh11.2bn investment planned in the same area risks being scuttled after the disgruntled residents moved to court to block the project. The four — Wemali Benson, Ali Mwakunyapa, Rashid Karungu and Hamisi Mwanga — have filed their case at the National Environment Tribunal court in Nairobi under certificate of urgency. Their lawyer William Anyangu Okaalo says the site in which the project is to be put up is threatening the lives of thousands of residents who live in proximity to the project. They further say it threatens and interferes with the residents’ rights to a safe and healthy environment. “Nema has proceeded to issue and EIA licence despite the unfavourable location of the site, and the unquantifiable threat posed to the thousand ands of residents of the area and both marine and dry environment surrounding the proposed site,” he says in court documents. MGT is owned by Dubai-based Milio International Limited, a trader of refined fuels.

The government is pursuing bilateral agreements with recruiting companies as it cracks down on rogue agencies that get Kenyan workers who end up exploited and abused in Gulf countries like Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. Labour Cabinet secretary Ukur Yatani said Kenya is also instituting a Labour Migration Policy and a Labour Migration Management Bill in response to the alarming number of mistreatment cases. “Some Kenyans seeking employment abroad and those already working there sometimes face challenges,” said Mr Yatani during the national Labour Day celebrations held in Nairobi. “To address this, the government has put in place measures from signing of bilateral labour agreements with key labour destination countries, vetting of all local private employment recruitment agencies by an interministerial committee in addition to posting of labour attaches.” He noted that labour migration contributes significantly to the development of the local economy. “The over four million Kenyans in diaspora provide immense human and capital resources in the form of remittances, knowledge, skills, and technology transfers. “Last year alone, the inward formal annual remittance stood at Sh270 billion,” Mr Yatani told the gathering. Conservative figures put the number of Kenyans currently working in Gulf countries at 100,000, but the true figure could be much higher. Most Kenyan migrants in these countries are employed as domestic workers and are vulnerable to abuse, exploitation, violence, rape and even murder.

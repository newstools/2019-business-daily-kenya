About 134 Kenyan entrepreneurs have been selected to be part of this year’s Tony Elumelu Foundation (TEF) Entrepreneurship Programme for being the most innovative and presenting high-potential business ideas. The number is a sharp increase from the 74 selected last year. The entrepreneurs are set to take part in the two-day 5th Annual Forum starting on July 26 in Abuja, Nigeria. The event provides a unique opportunity for young entrepreneurs from across 54 African countries to meet, learn and network with the broader African and global entrepreneurship ecosystem. Keynote speakers at the forum include Rwandan President Paul Kagame, and his Senegal counterpart Macky Sall. The two will join Tony Elumelu, TEF Founder and Chairman of Heirs Holdings and the United Bank for Africa (UBA) during the open house discussion. The Presidential Convention is a highlight of the forum, allowing the entrepreneurs in attendance to engage with political leaders, “to give first hand testimony of the important role government can play in catalysing growth and encouraging business ambition”. Since its inception, the programme has supported over 480 Kenyan entrepreneurs with training, mentorship and seed capital to grow their business. The Tony Elumelu Foundation was started in 2010 by Mr Elumelu, a Nigerian billionaire and philanthropist, to contribute in efforts aimed at spurring African economic growth through entrepreneurship.

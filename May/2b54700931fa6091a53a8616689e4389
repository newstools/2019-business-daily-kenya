US hotel chain Marriott has debuted in Kenya with the finalisation of the rebrand of Sankara Hotel. Sankara and Marriott Group last year signed a franchise agreement that would see the Westlands hotel trade under its independently operated premium brand, Autograph Collection. “As the first Autograph Collection Hotel in Kenya, Sankara Nairobi is a significant addition to our rapidly growing portfolio in the region and a testament to our conversion friendly strategy,” said Alex Kyriakidis President and Managing Director, Middle East and Africa, Marriott International. Sankara this year added 11 new suites as well as refurbishing the property ahead of adoption of the new branding. Sankara is set to benefit from Marriott’s world-class reservation systems and loyalty programmes. The franchise agreement with Westlands Hotels, the owner of the Sh3.2 billion Sankara Hotel, retains Sankara Hotel Group as the facility’s operator. Sankara opened in late 2010 riding on a resurgent tourism sector at the time that had caused a huge shortfall in Nairobi’s bed capacity. Marriott International currently operates two hotels in Nairobi, including the 172-room Four Points by Sheraton Nairobi Airport that opened in October 2017 and the 96-room Four Points by Sheraton Nairobi Hurlingham, which was a conversion. The global hospitality group announced plans to establish another facility under its affiliate Protea Hotel brand as part of its Sh31 billion investment by its partners in Nairobi. Protea Hotel by Marriott Nairobi will be located approximately five kilometres from Jomo Kenyatta International Airport on Mombasa Road and is expected to open its doors in 2021.

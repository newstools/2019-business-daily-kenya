The Government plans to build 34-storey public housing units with 3,000 apartments on Ngong Road, eight kilometres from Nairobi City centre.

According to Housing Principal Secretary Charles Hinga, each apartment in the 15 blocks will see three jobs created, translating to 4,110 for Parkroad project and 9,180 jobs on Ngong Road. Ngong Road houses will rise 34 floors, making it the highest residential property. It will comprise 285 one-bedroomed units, 1,768 two-bedrooms and 1,007 three-bedroomed units with three basement parking bays for 3,086 vehicles. Greatwall Gardens Regulatory filings indicate Parkroad project will have 1,048 parking bays, a social hall, kindergarten and retail shop spaces, among other auxiliary facilities.

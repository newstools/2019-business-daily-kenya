A company facing fraud charges together with former Nairobi Governor Evans Kidero did not file income tax returns for three years, a Nairobi court heard on Monday. Testifying before Chief Magistrate Douglas Ogoti, Mr Kennedy Wakoli, an assistant manager at Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) said the company — Lodwar Wholesalers, was a general trader and mostly dealt with sugar. He told the court that the company did not file returns for the years 2014 to 2016 but subsequently filed returns on iTax for 2014 and 2015. The company’s turnover was Sh201,375,260 in 2014 and Sh225,407,300 in 2015. The witness said while analysing bank statement from the company, he noticed several wire transfers from City Hall to Lodwar Wholesalers, from November 2013 to March 2016, totalling to Sh125 million. There were a total of 17 transfers. Mr Wakoli told the court that the company purchased sugar from Mumias, Kibos and Nzoia sugar companies and when they wrote to Mumias, the company provided ledgers of purchases from Lodwar totalling to Sh681 million. Evidence presented in court last week showed that the money would later be transferred to Mr Kidero’s accounts.

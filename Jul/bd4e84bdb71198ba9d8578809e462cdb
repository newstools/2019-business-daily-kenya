The importation of Sh800 million Chinese built footbridges for Thika Superhighway has been delayed further. The Kenya National Highways Authority (KeNHA), which opted to wield the bridges in China, missed the latest deadline of June to install the four footbridges. Plans to install the footbridges have been on the cards since August 2017 amid questions on when Kenya opted to build the bridges in China. Director-General Peter Mundinia now says the structures will arrive later this month and be installed in August. He said the KeNHA officials have inspected the footbridges in China and ready for dispatch. “Our team was in China to do an inspection before they are shipped. We are also making the slabs ready so that once they arrive, we will just need two weeks to fix them and open for use,” Mr Mundinia said, blaming a slower pre-export inspection for the delay in shipping the metal structures.

In a notice, the scandal-rocked State corporation says interested and qualified candidates must have a minimum of 15 years working experience, with at least 10 years in an executive management position. “KPC offers a competitive remuneration package in line with public service guidelines. The appointment will be for a contractual period of three years, renewable once for a similar period of time subject to satisfactory performance and delivery of set performance targets and outcomes,” the notice said.

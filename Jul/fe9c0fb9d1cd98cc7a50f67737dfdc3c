The welfare kitty targeting one million Kenyans is set to undergo an audit review to weed out dead and unscrupulous beneficiaries. Social Services PS Nelson Marwa said the August 4-17 audit will solve the puzzle of 10,917 registered beneficiaries who were paid Sh113 million in stipends last March but failed to show up to collect Sh87.3 million for the March-April and May-June cycles. “The validation exercise will address the 10,917 exceptions from the March-June 2019 payroll, identify ineligible and deceased beneficiaries to exit them,” he told county programme coordinators in Nairobi yesterday. The Inua Jamii programme is targeting 1,233,129 people — 833,129 orphans and vulnerable children, 353,000 senior citizens above 70 years and 47,000 persons living with severe disabilities — has disbursed Sh125.7 billion since inception. The beneficiaries now receive stipends via banks where they appear in person as opposed to the initial card-based system that allowed programme co-ordinators to pay out cash to beneficiaries. Mr Marwa said the validation exercise would scrutinise beneficiaries afresh with those enrolled on the platform brought on the accounts-based platform currently run by Co-op Bank, Equity Bank, KCB and Postbank.

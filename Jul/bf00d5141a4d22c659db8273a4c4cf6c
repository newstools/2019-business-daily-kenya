Unit trusts are popular with investors seeking management of funds within a larger diversified and more efficient pot, where investment decisions are taken by professionals who can gauge risk and rewarding opportunities. The most popular fund is the money markets fund, which is predominantly invested in risk-free government securities (near-cash, interest bearing instruments) and fixed deposits. This fund offers a relatively safe haven for investors who have a low risk appetite and are wary of fluctuating returns in other riskier asset classes such as equities. “The largest portion of the total assets under management was invested in government securities at 51.6 percent, with fixed deposits taking the second largest share at 20.26 percent,” said the CMA. Cash and demand deposits accounted for 11.67 percent of the total funds, CMA said, while equities accounted for 9.39 percent. Others are unlisted securities at 3.6 percent, investments in fellow collective schemes at 2.4 percent and offshore investments at 1.08 percent.

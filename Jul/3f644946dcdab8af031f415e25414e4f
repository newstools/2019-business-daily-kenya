Safaricom   will close all its shops Thursday for four hours in honour of the departed chief Executive Bob Collymore.

The late Collymore suffered acute Myeloid Leukaemia, which starts in the blood-forming cells of the bone marrow, leading to his death Monday. His body was cremated at a private event in Nairobi on Tuesday, where only family and close friends were allowed to attend. Wednesday, the firm appointed Kenya Airways  chairman Michael Joseph as the firm’s interim chief executive following the death of Bob Collymore Monday. Safaricom Company’s secretary Kathrynne Maundu said the appointment takes effect with immediate effect, until the board fills up the position on a permanent basis. Mr Collymore, who passed on Monday morning took over from Mr Joseph, a former Safaricom chief executive in November 2010.

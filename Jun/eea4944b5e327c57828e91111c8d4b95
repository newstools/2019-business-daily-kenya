The Kenya National Highways Authority (KeNHA) has hired two consultancy firms to prepare designs and a feasibility study for the proposed dualling of Muthaiga-Kiambu-Ndumberi road. KeNHA said Apec Consortium and Span Engineers working under a joint venture have been tasked with making the designs that incorporate views from residents. â€œThe government is preparing documentation for dualling of the road, an essential Nairobi-Kiambu link that runs for 25 kilometre. To facilitate this, public meetings are planned to provide project-affected persons and other stakeholders with an opportunity to give their views for adoption during preparation for sustainable measures, said the notice. The meetings start on June 18, 2019.

Cooperative bank group is set for a major system upgrade that will see its services interrupted for about 10 hours starting 10 pm on Saturday. In a public notice, the lender which has 155 branches, 11,600 banking agents and over 8.2 million customers says the upgrade is geared at improving the banking services experience. “This is to notify all Co-operative bank customers and the general public that we will be upgrading our IT network to improve system performance and provide faster banking services,” said the bank. “Therefore, all our banking services will be switched off from 10 pm Saturday 8 June to 8 am Sunday 9 June 2019.” The interruption will affect ATMs, mobile banking, Visa card, agencies, Saccolink, account to M-Pesa and Kenswitch among other services. Coop has been deepening its alternative service channels and successfully moved 88 per cent of all customer transactions to non-branch channels that allow for convenience banking beyond branch operating hours. In the first quarter of 2019, the bank said its all-telco Mco-op cash mobile wallet played a pivotal role in the growth of non-funded income. Over 4.3 million customers were registered and 1.2 million loans worth over Sh5.1 billion disbursed during this period

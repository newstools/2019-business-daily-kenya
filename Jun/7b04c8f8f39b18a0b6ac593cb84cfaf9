Nandi governor Stephen Sang has been arrested as police investigate him over the destruction of Kibwari tea estate, which is said to be on a grabbed piece of land. Detectives from the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) roughed up and bundled the county boss into their car Kapsabet Police Station on Monday afternoon as his supporters watched. Police lobbed teargas to disperse the surging crowd that had followed Mr Sang as he headed to the station to record statement. The governor was later driven to DCI offices in Kisumu where he is to be interrogated further. It was not immediately clear why the Jubilee county leader was taken to the lakeside city but it is believed police made the move on security grounds, given the threat posed by his supporters.

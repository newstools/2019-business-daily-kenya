An insurance brokerage firm wants an arrest warrant issued against two senior finance officers of the Mombasa County government for failing to pay it Sh94 million as ordered by a court. Disney Insurance Brokers wants county cabinet secretary for Finance Ms Asha Abdi and executive in charge of the department Ms Mariam Mbaruk arrested and taken to court to explain why they have not complying with the order. Through lawyer Gikandi Ngibuini, the firm said the two officials were required to pay the money following a conclusion of a case it had filed and won against the county. “The payment has not been effected and neither the county government nor the officers have shown any interest to settle the claim,” said Mr Ngibuini in the application. But through lawyer Elizabeth Kisingo, the county officials say they did not show wilful disobedience of court orders and therefore want the application dismissed. “The application is premature as the interest on the amount awarded has not been verified by the Deputy Registrar (of the High Court),” said Ms Kisingo.

Estonian taxi-hailing firm Bolt has unveiled its services in three additional towns across Kenya stepping up competition for its rivals Uber and Little, who already have a presence in these regions. Bolt, formerly Taxify, Wednesday launched its service in Thika, Kisumu and Kakamega adding to Nairobi and Mombasa cities which it entered in 2016 and 2017, respectively. The firm is set to unveil taxi, tuk-tuk and bodaboda services in these new towns. This latest launch makes makes Bolt the largest ride-hailing service provider in terms of geographical reach. Uber, its greatest rival, is currently in Nairobi, Thika and Mombasa towns only. Little has a presence in Nairobi, Mombasa and Kisumu. “After Nairobi and Mombasa cities, it was natural that Bolt would gradually expand across the country. We now intend to build new communities in Kisumu, Kakamega and Thika as we continue to gain the trust of the Kenyan people," said Bolt Country Manager in Kenya, Ola Akinnusi. “Launching in these areas will allow us to provide a safe and affordable avenue for passengers to get a ride,” said Mr Akinnusi.

East African Breweries Ltd (EABL) #ticker:EABL is expecting to receive 47,000 metric tonnes of barley this year following improved production. The brewer said production had increased 10 percent in Narok North sub-county. Speaking at the launch of the 8th edition of the Barley Growing Handbook during the annual field day in Mau Narok on Tuesday, East Africa Maltings Ltd (EAML) general manager Lawrence Maina said improved barley varieties launched recently had resulted in the higher output. However, Kenya Barley Growers Association Chairman David ole Kilesi expressed fear that heavy rain might affect harvesting. “We are late for harvesting for the last two weeks due to the rains, and the ripe crop is not turning black due to waterlogging in the fields. We are not sure we will reach the EABL threshold,” said Mr Kilesi. However, Mr Maina said a variety launched three years ago in partnership with the University of Eldoret at the Sansora farm in Mau Narok, Nakuru and KWS Aliciana would offer quality malting and brewing. It also produces many stems from one seed, increasing the yield for farmers, he said. “Our new varieties meet four key pillars — the farmers’ pillar where the farmer benefits from the yield per unit area and get more profit, good quality malting process, good for brewing and fine quality malt beer for our customers,” said Mr Maina. More than 300 stakeholders in the barley value chain attended the field day. The participants attend the annual event to learn, share experiences and showcase products as well as innovations. Barley is the main raw material for Kenya Breweries Ltd malt beers. Narok produces 60 percent of the commodity.

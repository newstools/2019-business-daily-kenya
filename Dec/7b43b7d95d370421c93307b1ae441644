Kenya nearly tripled the amount in loans it drew down from the International Development Association (IDA) to Sh142.3 billion ($1.4 billion) in the year ended June 2019, making it the world’s third-highest beneficiary of the kitty in the period. The IDA is the concessionary lending arm of the World Bank. The disbursements jumped by 161 percent from last year’s Sh54.6 billion ($538 million), showing Kenya’s increased appetite for debt, the World bank show in its 2019 annual report. Only Ethiopia ($2.237 billion/Sh227.3 billion) and Bangladesh ($1.934 billion/Sh196.5 billion) received higher disbursements from the IDA than Kenya. World Bank disclosures show Kenya’s highest loan item was $750 million (Sh76.2 billion) approved in May for budgetary support including the Big Four agenda projects. A further $250 million (Sh25.4 billion) had been approved in November and October last year for socio-economic inclusion projects such as health while $60 million (Sh6.1 billion) was marked as for Transformation and Regional Integration Project. IDA loans and grants are usually lent on concessional terms to help countries classified as poor to fund social projects such as primary education, basic health services, clean water and sanitation, business climate improvements, infrastructure and institutional reforms. “It provides financing in the form of development loans, grants, and guarantees to support these countries’ efforts to increase economic growth, reduce poverty, and improve the living conditions of the poor,” the World Bank states. IDA credits, also extended to countries that lack creditworthiness to borrow on market terms, come at a zero or very low-interest charge and repayments are stretched over 30 to 38 years, including a five to 10-year grace period.

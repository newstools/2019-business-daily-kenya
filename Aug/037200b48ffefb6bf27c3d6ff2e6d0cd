Keeping your house cool during the hot season can be dangerous to the environment, because an air conditioning unit can omit 1.34lbs of carbon dioxide for every kilowatt hour used. Replacing old air conditioners with new eco friendly air conditioning units will not only save money on electricity cost but also conserve the environment while keeping your house cool. When buying a new unit, look for one that has an energy star approval (a label given to a product by the US Environmental Protection Agency). This ensures that the product is 10 per cent more efficient that what is required by the minimum global standards. In addition, choose the proper size air conditioner for your home. This is because a unit that is either too small or too large for your living space will cause unnecessary drain on your electricity. Your vendor will be glad to advise you on the unit's size. An air conditioner that can dehumidify air is a good option for those living in humid climatic conditions. These units help make your house cool while reducing the humidity. You should also look for a conditioner that has a re-circulation option to allow re-circulation of already cooled air. This unit must be properly installed and sealed at all times to ensure cool air is not leaked outside. Lastly, be sure to clean and check the filters on your unit on a regular basis. Many air conditioners require to be cleaned every three months but depending on your area of residence you may need to clean your unit more often. This will ensure your eco friendly air conditioning unit is running more efficiently.

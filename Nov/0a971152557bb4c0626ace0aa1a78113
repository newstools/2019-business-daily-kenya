More than 800 participants, including several African heads of State, innovators, captains of industry, entrepreneurs, from around the world are expected to attend the Kusi Ideas Festival scheduled to take place next month in Rwanda’s capital, Kigali. It will take place on December 8 to 9 and is organised by the Nation Media Group (NMG)   in partnership with the Aga Khan Development Network (AKDN) and its affiliated organisations. Speaking during a media briefing, NMG Chairman Dr Wilfred Kiboro said the festival will provide a strategic platform for Africa to look back at the past 60 years and set the pace for the next 60 years. “There has been tremendous change in the continent in health, governance and education but there has also been great challenges such as famine, wars and genocides. If we are going to make a contribution to the world, we need to start thinking of the future,” he said. Also present at the briefing were NMG chief Executive Stephen Gitagama, AKDN Diplomatic Representative Dr Azim Lakhani and Aga Khan Health Service Board Chair Moyez Alibhai. Dr Lakhani noted that ADKN affiliated organisations, under the leadership of His Highness the Aga Khan, have over the past 60 years been a thought leader in Africa on issues such as education, infrastructure, health, environment and finance.

Listed regional underwriter CIC Insurance Group   has kicked off a search for a new chief executive following the abrupt resignation of former boss Tom Gitogo. In an advertisement published in the dailies on Wednesday, the firm said it was looking for an accomplished individual who has held senior managerial positions in companies similar to CIC’s portfolio with his/her main task being to provide ‘strategic direction and leadership’ for the group’s success. CIC has contracted consulting firm Deloitte to oversee the recruitment process. Mr Gitogo who took over from Nelson Kuria in 2014 left five months before the end of his contract in February 2020.
